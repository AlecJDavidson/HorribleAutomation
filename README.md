Thank you for downloading my project. There will be a few things you'll need to change to make it work for you.

Automate this by adding a job to run these scripts in your crontab.

You'll need to create a text file in the root of the project called "watchlist" and add the anime you want to it. Make sure to add each title on a new line or it will not work.

In move.py you'll need to replace the directories that I have with the paths to your downloads and anime directories.
